# ToDoList
 This of this as your reminder app but still without the reminders. You are able to add a list of todos that you can remove once completed.

How to Run:

1-Clone this repository

2-Open Index.js file

3-Enjoy!

Roadmap of future improvements: I am hoping to add scheduled dates and reminder signs for late todo items.
